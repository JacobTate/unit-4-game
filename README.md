Rules.<br>
 You will be given a random number at the start of the game.(1-100)<br>
 There are four Jewels on the screen. by clicking on a jewel you will add a specific ammount of points to Your
 total score.<br>
 the number is random 1-10 and is set until you ether win or lose.<br>
 You win the game by matching Your total score with the random number, you lose the game if Your total
 score goes above the random number.<br>
 The value of each jewel is hidden from You until You click on it.<br>
 Each time when the game starts, the game changes the value of each crystal.<br>
 
 There is a secret hard mode.<br>
 If You win 10 times and have lost less than 10 times in normal mode a hard mode button will pop up.<br>
 In the hard mode the random number will be 100-250 and the jewels are worth 10-25.<br>
 There is a button in hard mode to go back to normal mode.<br>
 When you click the button you will be asked if you want to go back, there are two buttons.<br>
 Contenue and stay in hard mode.<br>
 
 I created new files for hard mode and used a modified version of the normal mode code in them.<br>
