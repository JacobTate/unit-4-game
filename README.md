Rules.
 You will be given a random number at the start of the game.(1-100)
 There are four Jewels on the screen. by clicking on a jewel you will add a specific ammount of points to Your
 total score.
 the number is random 1-10 and is set until you ether win or lose.
 You win the game by matching Your total score with the random number, you lose the game if Your total
 score goes above the random number.
 The value of each jewel is hidden from You until You click on it.
 Each time when the game starts, the game changes the value of each crystal.
 
 There is a secret hard mode.
 If You win 10 times and have lost less than 10 times in normal mode a hard mode button will pop up.
 In the hard mode the random number will be 100-250 and the jewels are worth 10-25.
 There is a button in hard mode to go back to normal mode.
 When you click the button you will be asked if you want to go back, there are two buttons.
 Contenue and stay in hard mode.
 
 I created new files for hard mode and used a modified version of the normal mode code in them.
